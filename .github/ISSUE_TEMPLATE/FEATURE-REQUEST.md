# Short Description
<!-- One quick sentence giving a brief overview of what's up. -->

# Problem
<!--
Every change should be to solve a problem. That can be something as simple as
a painful-to-use API or as complex as a specific usecase that Chattor can't
meet, but you think it should.

Be sure to explain *why* this is a problem, too.
-->

# Solution

You've described the problem; now describe how you think it should be solved:
your actual feature request.
-->

# Workaround
<!--
If there's a way to fix this problem for now, describe it here. This helps
explain the problem, and can work as a quick fix for others until a real fix
is built.
