# Moderation Log

As mentioned in the [Code of Conduct][/conduct], some moderation actions are logged publicly.
That's mostly for accountability purposes -- it forces moderation actions to have a reason, ideally with examples.
It can also help with other communities' moderation, at least in the case of bans, which are reserved for extremely harmful behavior.

## Timeouts

Timeouts in Chattor spaces aren't particularly significant.
Someone being timed out usually just means they participated in a heated argument.
As such, while they're logged publicly -- so mods can't just time people they dislike out -- just *being on this list* doesn't mean they actually did anything that bad.

Also, because they're not that serious, timeouts 'age off' this page in a week.
The Chattor maintainers do keep a longer-term log internally, but only so patterns can be identified and acted upon.

- No one's been timed out in the last week! :)

## Bans

Bans are reserved for people who're either a serious harm to the community, e.g. bigots, or who have a history of doing mildly negative things.

- No one's been banned! :)
