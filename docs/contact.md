# Contacting Chattor

The best way to contact the Chattor devs is through [the Keybase team][keybase].
You can either ask your question straight in that team, or ask to get into the user, developer, or contributor subteams.
You can also generally DM any of the public admins.

The distant second best is to email the founder, Prismatic Obloquy, directly, at `prismatic@obloquy.work`.
If you do, be sure to clarify it's about Chattor in the subject line.

When you reach out, remember that you're reaching out to a volunteer.
We've got full-time jobs.
We'll try to get back to you promptly, but we can't make guarantees, especially not if you reach directly out to Prob.

If you're reaching out over a security issue, please do so privately, and be clear it's a security issue.
