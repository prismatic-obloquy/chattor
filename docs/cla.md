# Contributor License Agreement

This still needs to be sourced.

TL;DR: You agree to license any contributions submitted to Chattor under a perpetual, non-revocable license which allows us to use, reuse, edit, redistribute, etc. the contribution as we see fit under any license as part of Chattor.
Bog-standard stuff, really, so we can switch licenses e.g. if BSD 3 becomes obsolete or another license seems like a better fit.
