Are you concerned that anyone paying Instagram enough money could [find out everything about you][signal-ads]?
Are you tired of [data breach][breach1] after [data breach][breach2] after [breach][breach3] after [breach][breach4]?
Do you want to stop hearing about how big tech companies [tricked you out of your privacy][google-gdpr]?

Try Chattor.

Chattor is a free, encrypted, secure social network.
There's no tracking, no ads, and strong, mathematically guaranteed privacy.
Send messages, pass files, and make calls, all while knowing every bit of data is securely encrypted -- inaccessible to anyone listening in the middle.

No matter what, nothing personal or even uniquely identifying is ever shared unless *you* choose for it to be.
The only public identifier you have is a friend code, which is easily and quickly changed.

It supports text chat, file transfer, and offline messages, all with public-key cryptography and as anonymous as you want yourself to be.
It's built on Tor's onion services, and gives back to the network by encouraging every user to run a Tor relay too.

Chattor is built on proven, tested privacy technology:
All communications are over Tor, keeping things encrypted and anonymous at the transport layer.
The public-key cryptography is all ECC based on Curve25519, and the symmetric encryption is AES-256-GCM.
Monero's Bulletproofs are used as well, in the single place they're required.
