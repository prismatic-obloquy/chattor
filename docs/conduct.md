# Code of Conduct

> *This code of conduct was heavily inspired by [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), but is not identical to either.*
> *Please read it through* before *you contribute to Chattor, or join Chattor dev spaces.*

> *Thanks! -prob*

Chattor's Code of Conduct boils down to one simple rule:
Be excellent to each other.

Chattor's development spaces are open and inclusive.
Anywhere moderated by the maintainers is open to everyone, regardless of skill level, contribution amount, or identity.
Whether you've never written a line of code or you're Brian Wilson Kernighan, and no matter your race, gender, sexuality, or anything else, you're welcome to come help make Chattor better.

The exception, of course, is if you go against that very concept.
If you're racist, sexist, or transphobic, or if you harass or creep out people, or if in rejecting code you personally insult the submitter, you're welcome only to take your behavior elsewhere.
Chattor will be better off without you, as will the open-source community.

Note that, pragmatically, this Code of Conduct only applies to Chattor's official dev spaces.
While they're generally good rules for life, don't expect them to be enforced places where Chattor maintainers can't moderate, unless that space uses this same Code of Conduct.
Currently, the official Chattor spaces are:

- The GitHub repo, [github.com/prismatic-obloquy/chattor][repo]
- The [Chattor][keybase] team on Keybase

## All Contributors

Everyone in Chattor spaces, from Prismatic Obloquy to the newest curious stranger, is expected to be civil, kind, and open-minded.

* **Civil** means that you treat everyone with basic decency.
  Assume good faith, unless you have a strong reason not to.
  If you do have a reason, talk to a maintainer, rather than yelling at them in public.
  That gives them a chance to be gently corrected, and saves you the headache if gentle correction doesn't work.
- **Kind** means you go out of your way to help people, when you can.
  Don't talk over others or condescend, but if you're off topic and someone asks a relevant question, pause your discussion to answer it.
- **Open-minded** means that you take ideas seriously.
  They might still be bad, but you decide that only after giving them a fair shake.
  Even the oddest-sounding ideas can still be effective and useful.

Notably, none of this precludes disagreement.
It's entirely possible to disagree civilly, if the other person is being civil.
It's important that everyone involved stays 

It also doesn't permit bigotry.
No matter how you phrase it, hatred is impolite and has no place in Chattor's development.
For example, if you make racist remarks and others call you out, *you* were the rude one, not the people who called you out on it.

On top of bigotry, Chattor's dev spaces do not tolerate spam, advertising, or otherwise using the space for your own benefit.
Chattor's dev spaces are meant to improve Chattor, not your wallet or reputation.
If you want to talk about something you made, make it clear you made it.
Likewise, if you'd profit off people using or knowing about it, disclose that too.

Finally, try to keep Chattor's dev spaces relevant to Chattor, and on their designated topic.
This isn't a hard and fast rule, but the dev spaces are meant to be used for chatter about Chattor, and off-topic discussions can interfere with that.
If nothing else, people tend to avoid interrupting conversations.

## New Contributor Expectations

When you propose your first contribution, whether it's an issue or pull request, be prepared for some *constructive* criticism.
No one should be yelling at you, but you'll hopefully get a few comments on your stuff.
Remember that they're about what you've proposed, not you as a person, and that they're trying to help make Chattor better.
Also remember that the people making those comments are human, and not necessarily very good with words -- give them the benefit of the doubt if they're unclear or even condescending.

When you get comments, please address them promptly, even if just to say you're working on it.
Everyone working on Chattor is a volunteer, and that means an inherently limited amount of time to work on things.
The longer it takes you to reply, the less fresh it'll be in everyone's minds, and the more time they'll have to spend rereading it.
That means less time actually reviewing your work, and less work merged into Chattor.

It's also important to remember that you probably don't have as much Chattor-specific context as the more veteran contributors.
Even the [greatest developer on Earth][hamilton] will still encounter unexpected corner cases and need to be introduced to any particular project.

Last but not least:
You're new here, but your experience and skills -- even if they're not in programming -- are still valuable.
Be patient with people who mean well, and be generous with assuming good faith, but give no quarter to anyone intentionally insulting or demeaning you.

## Veteran Contributor Expectations

Chattor works best when everyone can contribute.
As veteran contributors, you have a bit of authority and experience in Chattor, and you should use it to encourage new contributors to put their best work in.
For example, go out of your way to figure out someone's experience level with the languages or concepts in their proposal, to avoid condescending.
Don't berate them from mistakes or just point out where things are wrong, when you could explain exactly what is wrong and, maybe, how to fix it.

Remember also that every upgrade is valuable.
Small bug- or typo-fixes, or small features, might not individually be all that valuable, but each makes Chattor a little better, and they provide an invaluable starting point for new contributors.
You'll be able to fix the little things more quickly as you gain experience, but you'll also be able to tackle the more complex things that new contributors just can't.
Use your judgement here:
Would the issue make a good starting point for new folks?
Is it causing any notable issues?
If your answers are respectively yes and no, consider leaving it open and pinging a maintainer to tag it as a good first issue.

Finally, try to be prompt.
Like everyone else here, you're a volunteer, and you're under no *obligation* to respond quickly to no issues or feature requests -- but [Mozilla found][mozilla-reply-study] that code reviewes within 48 hours mean people come back and contribute more.

## Maintainer Expectations

Maintainers are given a special level of trust in the project, with access to various moderation and security tools, and thus have an especially high standard to meet.
Maintainers are still volunteers, but the privileges still come with some responsibilities.
You're expected to act as 'professionally' as the veteran contributors, but moreso.

On top of that, maintainers handle any Code of Conduct issues in the community, and need to be able to keep a cool enough head to deal with some potentially very nasty people without making the situation worse.
As a rule of thumb this means banning them without engaging, no matter how tempting it is.
For less nasty people, it can mean dealing with their anger in DMs when they feel you've been unfair.

Of course, maintainers handle many of the administrative issues as well.
Tagging issues, reviewing and merging pull requests, maintaining the website, etc. can take a fair bit of time, but need to be done.
They keep things moving smoothly, and encourage people to contribute.

## Consequences

Chattor uses a broadly three-tiered system for moderating bad behavior.

Some moderation actions are [publicly logged][/modlog].

- **Warnings** are private or public notices to the user.
  For example, if Alice misgenders Bob, a maintainer may politely remind Alice of Bob's pronouns.
  If Alice made an innocent mistake and corrects it in the future, nothing else comes of it.

  Warnings are typically informal, and don't have any explicit "expiration".
  However, they are tracked internally to catch patterns.

- **Timeouts**, temporary bans, are mainly for cooling down heated discussions.
  They pause arguments long enough for maintainers to figure out what's going on.
  They can also be used to firmly warn people off continuing with behavior, as a sort of last warning.

  Timeouts are much more formal, and logged publicly for moderation accountability.
  Your name will be on the public list for a week, but also tracked internally longer to catch patterns.

- **Bans**, i.e. permanent ones, are reserved for severe offenses.
  They're logged publicly, forever, both for accountability purposes and to assist others with moderating their own communities.

Moderation actions can generally be appealed, by reaching out to a maintainer directly.
This isn't an excuse to harass the maintainers, though, and doing that *will* get you permanently banned.
